## üí° **Hackathon Theme: Call Center Optimization Challenge**
### **Problem Statement**

United Airlines strives to offer **world-class customer service**, and our call centers play a critical role. However, we're facing challenges with metrics like **Average Handle Time (AHT)** and **Average Speed to Answer (AST)**.

### **Your Task**
Analyze our call center data to:
- Identify inefficiencies that increase AHT and AST.
- Propose strategies to reduce resolution times, enhance customer satisfaction, and improve overall operational efficiency.

---

## üõ† **Background**
In the competitive airline industry, optimizing call center operations is key to customer retention. Metrics like AHT and AST are crucial for performance:

- **AHT (Average Handle Time)**: Time an agent spends on a call. Reducing AHT improves efficiency and service quality.
- **AST (Average Speed to Answer)**: Time customers spend waiting to connect with an agent. Lower AST enhances customer experience and reduces call abandonment.

United Airlines uses both human agents and **IVR (Interactive Voice Response)** systems to handle calls. There's an opportunity to better allocate resources between self-service tools and human intervention to streamline the process.

### üìà **How are AHT and AST Calculated?**
- **AHT (Average Handle Time)** = Total Handle Time / Total Number of Calls
- **AST (Average Speed to Answer)** = Total Waiting Time / Total Number of Calls

---

## üîç **Deliverables**
### **Key Insights**
1. **Long AHT**: Identify factors contributing to extended call durations, such as agent performance and call types. Determine key drivers of long AHT and AST during peak periods.
   
2. **IVR Optimization**: Analyze call transcripts and reasons to identify self-solvable issues. Recommend IVR improvements to reduce unnecessary escalations.

3. **Call Categorization**: Analyze patterns in incoming calls to improve resource allocation and streamline processes.

4. **Bonus Task**: Use `test.csv` to generate and submit predictions.
