## 💡 Hackathon Theme: Call Center Optimization Challenge**
### Problem Statement

United Airlines strives to offer world-class customer service, and our call centers play a critical role. However, we're facing challenges with metrics like Average Handle Time (AHT) and Average Speed to Answer (AST).

### Our Task
Analyze our call center data to:
- Identify inefficiencies that increase AHT and AST.
- Propose strategies to reduce resolution times, enhance customer satisfaction, and improve overall operational efficiency.

---

## 🛠 Background
In the competitive airline industry, optimizing call center operations is key to customer retention. Metrics like AHT and AST are crucial for performance:

- AHT (Average Handle Time): Time an agent spends on a call. Reducing AHT improves efficiency and service quality.
- AST (Average Speed to Answer): Time customers spend waiting to connect with an agent. Lower AST enhances customer experience and reduces call abandonment.

United Airlines uses both human agents and IVR (Interactive Voice Response) systems to handle calls. There's an opportunity to better allocate resources between self-service tools and human intervention to streamline the process.

### 📈 How are AHT and AST Calculated?
- AHT (Average Handle Time) = Total Handle Time / Total Number of Calls
- AST (Average Speed to Answer) = Total Waiting Time / Total Number of Calls

## 🔍 Deliverables
### Key Insights
1. Long AHT: Identify factors contributing to extended call durations, such as agent performance and call types. Determine key drivers of long AHT and AST during peak periods.
   
2. IVR Optimization: Analyze call transcripts and reasons to identify self-solvable issues. Recommend IVR improvements to reduce unnecessary escalations.

3. Call Categorization: Analyze patterns in incoming calls to improve resource allocation and streamline processes.

4. Bonus Task: Use `test.csv` to generate and submit predictions.
